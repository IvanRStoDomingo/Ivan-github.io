# My top 3 favorite champions in league of legends
# No 1 - AKALI
Abandoning the Kinkou Order and her title of the Fist of Shadow, Akali Akali now strikes alone, ready to be the deadly weapon her people need. Though she holds onto all she learned from her master Shen, she has pledged to defend Ionia from its enemies, one kill at a time. Akali may strike in silence, but her message will be heard loud and clear: fear the assassin with no master. 
# ABILITIES:

# PASSIVE
ASSASSIN'S MARK
Dealing spell damage to a champion creates a ring of energy around them. Exiting that ring empowers Akali's next autoattack with bonus range and damage.

# Q
FIVE POINT STRIKE
Akali throws out five kunai, dealing damage based on her bonus Attack Damage and Ability Power and slowing.

# W
TWILIGHT SHROUD
Akali drops a cover of smoke and briefly gains Move Speed. While inside the shroud, Akali becomes invisible and unable to be selected by enemy spells and attacks. Attacking or using abilities will briefly reveal her.

# E
SHURIKEN FLIP
Flip backward and fire a shuriken forward, dealing magic damage. The first enemy or smoke cloud hit is marked. Re-cast to dash to the marked target, dealing additional damage

# R
PERFECT EXECUTION
Akali leaps in a direction, damaging enemies she strikes. Re-cast: Akali dashes in a direction, executing all enemies she strikes.

# NO 2 - SERAPHINE 
Turn the sounds of souls around you into music with Seraphine, the Starry-Eyed Songstress. Learn more about her magical auditory synesthesia and musical abilities.
"ONE DAY, THE MUSIC WILL STOP. BETTER DANCE WHILE YOU CAN!"
